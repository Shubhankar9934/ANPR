# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Project

## Project Summary

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project is a comprehensive system for detecting and recognizing license plates in images and video streams. This project showcases proficiency in computer vision and deep learning techniques and serves as a practical demonstration of ANPR technology.

### Key Components

- **License Plate Detection:** Utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to accurately locate license plates in images and video streams, even in challenging conditions.

- **Character Segmentation:** Employed image processing and contour analysis to segment individual characters from license plates, ensuring precise character separation.

- **Character Recognition:** Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize characters and digits on license plates, achieving a recognition accuracy rate of [80%].

- **Real-Time Processing:** Designed the system to operate in real-time, efficiently processing video feeds from surveillance cameras without compromising accuracy.

- **Integration:** Integrated the ANPR system into GCP, demonstrating its practical use in traffic management, access control, and security applications.

- **Scalability:** Engineered the project to be scalable, enabling the addition of new features or integration with other systems. Ensured flexibility for future enhancements and customization.
